## Lagunas Claras – Design System

This document defines the visual and design rules for the Lagunas Claras website.
All UI and visual decisions must follow this system.

## Brand Personality

- Professional
- Technical
- Natural
- Trustworthy
- Calm

Avoid:

- Playful or cartoonish styles
- Over-saturated greens
- “Eco cliché” visuals

---

## Color System

Colors are defined using semantic tokens.
Do NOT use raw HEX or RGB values in components.

### Core Tokens

- `primary` → Brand / CTAs
- `secondary` → Support elements
- `accent` → Highlights
- `background` → Main background
- `foreground` → Text
- `muted` → UI surfaces, borders

All colors are implemented via CSS variables and Tailwind tokens.

## Typography

- Sans-serif, modern, readable
- Clear hierarchy
- No decorative fonts

Usage:

- Headings → strong but calm
- Body → neutral and readable
- Avoid excessive font weights

## Spacing & Layout

- Prefer generous white space
- Avoid dense layouts
- Use consistent vertical rhythm
- Desktop-first approach

---

## Components

- Built on shadcn/ui primitives
- Extended only when necessary
- No custom styling that breaks tokens

Buttons:

- Primary → main actions
- Secondary → supportive actions
- Avoid more than 2 button styles per view

## Sections & Composition

Hero sections:

- Strong headline
